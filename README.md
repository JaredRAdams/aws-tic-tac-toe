The most challenging part of the assignment was when we tried to write the CLI frontend in javascript while neither of us knew how to code in java script
Once we realized that we didnt know what we were doing, we used the small framework we had managed to create and used ChatGPT to help transfer that code over to Python, which we do know how to code in

We were able to fully implement all features in this project and they all work properly
